# STEM103_Level3_1-ForLoop

Hello, my name is Jack Towler. Today is 2/23/25, and the current assignment is relatively simple (Supposedly). I've just finished the in class work, and will be working on both this assignment and the previous (Functions) assignment. Hopefully I can do well and get things done.
